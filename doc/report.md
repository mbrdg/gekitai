# Problem Formalization

## State Representation

- The state of the game is represented by a **matrix of 6x6**.
- The **initial state** is represented by an **empty matrix**.


> - An example of the state representation would be:
```python
state = [[None,    1, None, None, None, None],
         [None,    1, None,    2, None, None],
         [None, None, None, None, None, None],
         [None,    1,    2, None,    2, None],
         [   2, None,    2, None, None,    1]]
```

## Objective Test

- There are 2 possible ways to win the game:

    1. If a player line up **3 pieces in a row** at the end of their turn (after pushing);
    2. If a player have all of their **8 markers in the board** (after pushing).

## Operators

- The rules of the game are pretty simple, thus we've just defined a single operator.

### `move(curent_state, position)`

- Arguments:
    1. Current State - 6x6 matrix;
    2. Position - pair of coordinates.

- Preconditions:
    1. `board[i][j] == None`

- Effects:
    1. `board[i][j] = Player`
    2. The neighbour markers might:
        1. Be pushed away from the new marker by one space if that same spot is
           empty;
        2. Stay in the same place if they can't be moved, i.e. there's another
           marker in the destination space;
        3. Be returned to the player if they fall out of the board after being
           pushed.

- Cost:
    - `1`, all the moves have the same cost, possibly we want the algorithm to make the minimum number of moves possible.
