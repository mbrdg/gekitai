# Problem Formalization

## State Representation

- The state of the game is represented by a **matrix of 6x6** and some additional data (eg. current turn).
- The **initial state** is represented by an **empty board**.
- Player's markers are represented by a boolean:
    - `False` for player 1,
    - `True` for player 2.

> - An example of the game's board representation would be:
```python
board = [[None, False, None, None, None,  None],
         [None, False, None, True, None,  None],
         [None,  None, None, None, None,  None],
         [None, False, True, None, True,  None],
         [True,  None, True, None, None, False]]
```


## Objective Test

- There are 2 possible ways to win the game:

    1. If a player line up **3 pieces in a row** at the end of their turn (after pushing);
    2. If a player have all of their **8 markers in the board** (after pushing).

## Operators

- The [rules](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/295449/gekitai) of the game are pretty simple, thus we've just defined a single operator.

### `move(curent_state, position)`

- Arguments:
    1. Current State;
    2. Position - pair of coordinates.

- Preconditions:
    1. `state.board[i][j] == None`

- Effects:
    1. `state.board[i][j] = state.player`
    2. The neighbour markers might:
        1. Be pushed away from the new marker by one space if that same spot is
           empty;
        2. Stay in the same place if they can't be moved, i.e. there's another
           marker in the destination space;
        3. Be returned to the player if they fall out of the board after being
           pushed.
    3. `state.player = not state.player`

- Cost:
    - `1`, all the moves have the same cost, possibly we want a board evaluation that takes the minimum number of moves possible.
